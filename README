# Portfolio Website

A responsive, editable portfolio website with fingerprint-based authentication and Supabase backend integration.

### Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- A Supabase account (free at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))

### 1. Fork & Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfoliowebsite.git
cd portfoliowebsite
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase (Required for Data Persistence)
Follow the detailed [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md) guide to:
- Create a Supabase project and database table
- Get your API credentials
- Set up GitHub Secrets for secure deployment

### 3. Configure Authentication
The site uses fingerprint-based authentication. To find your fingerprint:

1. Open the site locally (`index.html` in your browser)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. You'll see a message like: `Your fingerprint: -1877139945`
4. Copy this number and update `script.js` line 5:
   ```javascript
   this.authorizedFingerprints = ['-1877139945', 'YOUR_FINGERPRINT_HERE'];
   ```

### 4. Deploy with GitHub Actions
The repository includes automated GitHub Actions deployment:
- Push to main branch automatically deploys to GitHub Pages
- Supabase credentials are securely injected during build
- No manual deployment steps needed

### 5. Edit Your Portfolio
1. Visit your live site
2. You'll automatically be in edit mode (fingerprint authentication)
3. Click "Preview Mode" to toggle between edit and preview
4. Add your experiences, projects, about section, and profile photo
5. All changes are saved to Supabase and visible to all visitors
